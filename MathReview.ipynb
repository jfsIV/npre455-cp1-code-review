    "Basic Python supports a plethora of math operators. The various rudimentary math operators are: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and power (`**`). This syntax is standard across most coding languages, however it should be noted that many languages do not have built in power (`**`) (looking at you C++). With the rudimentary operators introduced, lets get into to how to use them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python (like most coding languages) has the notion of a 'variable', or an object that holds information. A variable is known as an 'lvalue', because it must be instantiated on the left hand side of an equal sign (this comes from before C++ {} and () constructors). Numbers, like `4` and `7` are 'rvalues', because they cannot be used to store data and must be used exclusively on the right hand side of an equal sign. Lets do some examples of variable initializing.\n"
